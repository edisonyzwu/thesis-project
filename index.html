              Tens of thousands of Chinese migrants have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since the
              pandemic, many trading a middle-class life in China for one that’s humbler and one
              that remains threatened under Trump’s second administration.

              t 5 a.m., Denvy Jiang’s alarm buzzes to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jiang rises quietly, careful not to wake his wife and two children or the four other
              families in the shared house. He wolfs down a few bites of the breakfast his wife set
              out the night before, grabs his car key and slips into his secondhand Honda.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minutes later, he’s merging onto the 88 highway, bound for a delivery warehouse nearly
              20 miles away.
            </p>

            <p>
              Six months ago, his life looked quite different. He lived in China with his wife,
              where they owned their home and enjoyed a more comfortable life as private tutors — a
              profession offering social respect and substantial earnings.
            </p>

            <p>
              But Jiang had publicly questioned the government, putting him and his family at risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              They sold their home and car, traveled through Japan and then made their way to
              Mexico. Under the cover of night, they crossed the U.S.–Mexico border with their young
              son and daughter—entering a country they had never set foot in.

              Since the pandemic, a record number of Chinese nationals have crossed the border,

            </p>

            <p>
              Many left behind middle-class jobs and stable lives, hoping to plant new roots in
              unfamiliar soil and escape political repression and economic uncertainty.

              Unlike many migrants flee war or extreme poverty, many Chinese newcomers come from
              China’s urban middle class, who were once teachers, business owners, and civil
              servants.
            </p>

            <p>
              In post-pandemic China, a slowing economy and growing political pressure pushed some
              to look abroad. Online, they found step-by-step guides to reach the U.S.—a risky
              journey through multiple countries that ends at the border and can cost $10,000 to
              $40,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              For those who make it across the border, their challenges just begin: low-wage jobs,
              the threat of deportation, and the loneliness of life in a foreign land.

            <h2>A Search for Freedom</h2>
            <p>
              Jiang grew up in a small county town in Jiangsu province, near Shanghai. Ten years
              ago, fresh out of vocational college, he became an English tutor.
            </p>

            <p>
              For years, he and his wife commuted between Jiangsu and Shanghai — he taught English,
              she taught math. They worked only on weekends and spent the rest of the week at home
              with their children. During holidays, they often traveled abroad, with Japan as a
              favorite destination.
            </p>

            <p>
              In May 2018, after years of saving, they bought their first car: a new Chevrolet.
              Later that year, they purchased a 1,400-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in their
              hometown—a place they could finally call home.
            </p>

            <p>To their friends, Jiang’s life looked stable and respectable, even enviable.</p>

            <p>But he longed for one thing China forbade: freedom of expression.</p>

            <p>
              Since high school, Jiang had been bypassing China’s internet firewall to access
              foreign news. He noticed that in the U.S., people can speak freely to criticize
              authority and participate in politics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Around 2015, when WeChat became widely used in China, Jiang said he launched a public
              account and started publishing essays, pointing out what he saw as government
              failures.
            </p>

            <p>
              His most popular article criticizing the government drew more than 60,000 views, but
              none of his friends showed support.
            </p>

            <p>
              “People couldn’t understand why I’d challenge the government,” he said. “They thought
              I was asking for trouble.”
            </p>

            <p>Still, Jiang believed it was his duty to speak up.</p>

            <p>“Everyone wants their country to get better,” he said, tearing up.</p>

            <p>Eventually, local authorities took notice.</p>

            <p>
              At first, the police took a relatively restrained approach. They asked Jiang to delete
              his articles and warned him not to publish similar content again. But as the warnings
              piled up, so did the pressure. The tone grew harsher, then came the threats.
            </p>

            <p>
              Jiang said the police didn’t just target him. They warned that if he was labeled a
              political dissident, his children might be barred from school or later denied jobs in
              the government.
            </p>

            <p>
              Constantly worried about his family's safety and future, Jiang was eventually
              diagnosed with major depression.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I had a decent job in China,” he said, “but I couldn’t trade it for the right to
              speak freely. I have a family. I have kids. If I get locked up for a few years, what
              happens to them?”
            </p>

            <p>The final blow came during the pandemic.</p>

            <p>
              China’s zero-COVID policies had already made life difficult, but what alarmed Jiang
              most was the government’s tight control of information. Even during major public
              tragedies and protests, he noticed little to no coverage on domestic platforms. To
              learn what was happening in his own country, he bypassed the firewall and turned to
              Twitter and YouTube.
            </p>

            <p>Tired of living in the dark — he knew it was time to leave.</p>

            <p>
              For him, the decision was driven by a desire to escape political suppression. Others,
              like Chao Chen, 44, were pushed by the economic fallout of the pandemic.
            </p>

            <p>
              For more than two decades, he had run a small security equipment company in China,
              managing a team of ten. He earned over one million yuan a year (roughly $140,000),
              placing him well above the national average.
            </p>

            <p>Then the pandemic upended everything.</p>

            <p>
              China’s strict zero-COVID lockdowns triggered widespread job losses. In just the first
              two months of 2020, five million positions vanished, and Tens of thousands of private
              businesses collapsed. According to the corporate registry platform Tianyancha, over
              460,000 small and medium-sized enterprises were dissolved in early 2022 alone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Chinese consumers have turned more cautious, citing concerns over wage growth and job
              security as companies cut staff to preserve profits and competitiveness. The country’s
              consumer confidence index fell to its lowest level since the COVID-19 outbreak and
              remains depressed.

            </div>
            <p>
              Chen’s business began to falter. He found himself thinking back to his youth — his
              early interest in English, his dreams of working in international trade, and maybe one
              day going abroad.
            </p>

            <p>
              To him, America represented higher wages, greater personal freedom, better healthcare,
              and more opportunities for his son.
            </p>

            <p>
              Chen planned to go first, alone, and try to build a foundation in the U.S. If it
              worked, he would bring his wife and son later.
            </p>

            <p>
              He never imagined that, twenty years later, he would pursue a long-abandoned dream,
              even if it meant leaving behind those he loved most.

                course of eight years, he gradually grew his income to 20,000 yuan and then to an
                annual salary of 300,000–500,000 yuan ($41,000 – $69,000).

              Zhang, 32, owned an e-commerce livestreaming business in Hebei, northern China, while
              his wife stayed at home to care for their child.
            </p>
            <p>
              He hadn’t started out wealthy. Zhang began his career as a low-level employee at an
              e-commerce service company, earning just 5,000 yuan a month (around $690). Over the
              course of eight years, he gradually grew his income to 20,000 yuan and then to an
              annual salary of 300,000–500,000 yuan ($41,000 – 69,000).
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2021, after years of saving, Zhang and his wife bought a new 120-square-meter
              apartment. They were full of hope for the future. But then the pandemic hit — and
              everything changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zhang’s first impressions of America had taken root more than a decade earlier. In his
              early twenties, he was a regular viewer of Xiaoshuo (“Talks With Gao Xiaosong”), a
              hugely popular Chinese talk show. On the show, Gao spoke casually but insightfully
              about Western institutions, history, and how Americans enjoyed political freedoms,
              legal rights, and the dignity of choice. Zhang came to see the U.S. as “a beacon of
              democracy,” where anyone could live a decent life through hard work. That idea stuck
              with him for years. It took a crisis to bring it to the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              In late 2020, at the height of COVID-19, Zhang’s infant daughter began showing strange
              eye movements, a persistent twitch. She had been born prematurely and had already
              survived two serious lung infections. Concerned about her fragile health, Zhang feared
              the worst.
            </p>
            <p>
              He and his wife rushed to Beijing Children’s Hospital, hoping to see a neurologist.
              But before they could even explain, the doctor asked for their travel history via
              China’s mandatory COVID “health code” app, which tracked users’ movements and exposure
              risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he saw that their registered household was in Shijiazhuang, a city with active
              COVID cases, the doctor refused to see them. He called security and had the family
              escorted out of the clinic.
            </p>
            <p>“Get out,” he said. “We don’t accept patients from there.”</p>
            <p>
              Zhang pleaded. , explaining that he didn’t live in Shijiazhuang, that he was only
              registered there, and offeredoffering to keep the visit off the official record so the
              doctor wouldn’t face liability. But none of it worked. All he wanted was a verbal
              confirmation: that his child wasn’t having seizures, but this reassurance never came.
            </p>
            <p>
              “There was no compassion,” Zhang said. “He wasn’t acting like a doctor. He was just
              protecting his job.”
            </p>
            <p>
              During the COVID-19 lockdown, Zhang also had started watching Chinese-language YouTube
              channels hosted overseas, particularly those that analyzed China’s economy using
              official data.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The more I watched, the more scared I got,” Zhang said. “Sometimes, I’d wake up at
              night soaked in sweat.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Between the anxiety over his child’s health and the bleak economic forecasts, Zhang’s
              faith in the future began to collapse. He decided he couldn’t wait any longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              To leave China, Zhang sold an old apartment and his BMW X5. The new home had just been
              renovated, with over 100,000 yuan poured into it. Letting it go felt too hard, so they
              kept it, partly for comfort, partly as a backup plan.
            </p>
            <p>He moved his assets into a Hong Kong bank account.</p>
            <p>
              “I wasn’t afraid of being poor,” he said. “I was afraid that when I wanted to leave,
              I’d be trapped.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Zhang didn’t hesitate. The only painful part was leaving his father who had been
              diagnosed with multiple system atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative disease with no known
              cure.
            </p>
            <p>Doctors gave him only a few years to live.</p>
            <p>“I may never see him again,” Zhang said. “But he supported my decision.”</p>
            <p>
              With his father’s blessing, Zhang boarded a plane with his wife and daughter, and left
              everything else behind.

            <h2>Journey to the US</h2>
            <p>
              For some, entry to the U.S. was relatively easy, requiring nothing more than a tourist
              visa.
            </p>

            <p>
              But since the 2015 fiscal year, the number of non-immigrant visas issued to Chinese
              nationals has dropped sharply.
            </p>

            <p>As access shrank, new — and sometimes dangerous — pathways emerged.</p>

            <p>
              Jiang and his family, who had multiple entries to Japan on record, were eligible to
              enter Mexico visa-free. From there, they traveled to the border city of Tijuana, then
              crossed into the U.S.
            </p>

            <p>
              Others were not so lucky. Without visa exemptions, many Chinese migrants were forced
              to take longer, more dangerous, and far more expensive journeys.

                Some tried to schedule asylum appointments through the U.S. Customs and Border
                Protection mobile app, CBP One. But the app had no Chinese-language interface and
                its opaque scheduling system left many confused and frustrated. For some, waiting
                wasn't an option. They chose instead to scale the border wall at night and apply for
                asylum afterward.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once they reached the U.S., migrants were immediately detained by immigration
                authorities — some held for a single day, others for weeks or even months.

                Their asylum cases can take years to process, and during that time, they are not
                permitted to leave the country.

                In Tijuana, Zhang and his family were taken to a house on a hilltop, arranged by a

                sofa and a pull-out bed. Surveillance cameras were mounted in the corners. Every

              </p>
              <p>On their third night, at 4 a.m., they set out.</p>
              <p>
                By 5 a.m., with the sky still dark, a car dropped them at the base of a mountain.
              </p>

              <p>
                Zhang checked his phone: the straight-line distance to the U.S. border was just 2.8
                miles.
              </p>

              <p>But what looked short on the map was far more treacherous in reality.</p>

              <p>Two silent Mexican guides led the way.</p>

              <p>
                The mountain was low, but winding. They walked through wild brush, following a faint
                trail worn by others. At times it was wide enough for two people, other times barely
                the width of a footstep.
              </p>

              <p>
                Zhang’s wife carried a 20-pound backpack. Zhang strapped their 30-pound daughter to
                his chest with a harness. The slope was steep and slick. One misstep could have sent
                them sliding down a ravine. His calves began to cramp. He stumbled more than once,
                clenching his jaw to stay upright.
              </p>

              <p>As they walked, dawn crept in.</p>

              <p>
                Again and again, Zhang asked, “How much farther?” Each time, the guides replied,
                “One hour.”
              </p>

              <p>An hour passed.</p>

              <p>Then another.</p>

              <p>Still, they climbed.</p>

              <p>
                By 9:30 a.m., exhausted, they reached the top. Zhang looked back, and realized they
                had crossed not one mountain, but several.
              </p>

              <p>Ahead of them was the U.S.–Mexico border.</p>

              <p>
                It wasn’t a tall concrete wall or an imposing steel fence. It was a worn,
                one-meter-high strand of barbed wire, which is bent, trampled, and barely standing.
              </p>

              <p>They stepped over it, as simply as crossing a line.</p>

              <p>There was no cheering, no tears, just fatigue.</p>

              <p>
                Zhang’s legs were trembling, locked in cramps. His wife was drenched in sweat. But
                their daughter never cried, not once.
              </p>

              <p>“She’s only four,” Zhang said. “But she understood she had to stay quiet.”</p>

              <p>
                “I felt nothing,” he said later. “We were already too exhausted to feel anything at
                all.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Like many migrants who enter with children, Zhang and his family were quickly
                detained by border patrol agents, but only for a short time. After less than 24
                hours in custody, they were released and allowed to file their asylum claim.

            <h2 class="American-life-title">From the Ground Up</h2>

            <p>
              Two months after arriving in the U.S., the country he believes offers him freedom of
              speech, Jiang earned his driver’s license and landed his first job — a package
              delivery driver.
            </p>

            <p>
              Paid $1.80 to $2.00 per package, his earnings depended on how many deliveries he could
              make each day.
            </p>

            <p>
              Though Jiang knew that he had to “start from the ground up” in the U.S., reality was
              still harsher than he had imagined, he said.
            </p>

            <p>
              While he had worked just three days a week with little physical effort back in China,
              now, he is on the road six days a week, working ten hours or more each day with barely
              any time to rest.
            </p>

              <figcaption class="italic">Jiang sets out for work before dawn.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Before the sun rose, Jiang was already en route to his first stop: the warehouse.</p>

            <p>
              In the warehouse, dozens of tall metal carts packed with grey plastic-wrapped parcels
              were already lined up in rows.
            </p>

            <p>Jiang said he usually delivered between 150 and 180 packages a day.</p>

            <p>
              He located the cart marked with his route number and strained to push it toward his
              car’s trunk. Each package was scanned into his phone’s dispatch system and assigned a
              route code.
            </p>

            <p>Over time, the routine became second nature: scan, tag, sort, load.</p>

            <p>
              Box after box filled the back of the car. Soon, the passenger seat and rear seats were
              piled high with parcels. Only the driver’s seat remained clear.
            </p>

            <p>After nearly six months on the job, he had run every route three or four times.</p>

            <p>
              He knew which intersections always backed up, which buildings had broken buzzers, and
              which doorways hid aggressive dogs.
            </p>

            <p>
              By 7:30 a.m., Jiang entered the address for his first delivery into the GPS and began
              his route.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the stop, he rummaged through the back of the car to find the correct package,
              scanned it, double-checked the address, and stepped out. He glanced around for the
              correct unit number, jogged to the front porch, gently placed the parcel by the door,
              snapped a photo for proof of delivery, and then jogged back to the car. With one hand
              on the seatbelt, he punched in the next address as the engine revved again.
            </p>

            <p>
              The entire process took less than three minutes, but he had to repeat it over a
              hundred times a day.

            </div>

            <p>
              During deliveries, Jiang often wore a furrowed brow and tight lips, like a sprinter at
              the starting line, every second counting toward the final result.
            </p>

            <p>
              By noon, his shirt was drenched in sweat. He’d jump back into the car and crank the
              A/C, but could afford to cool down for only a minute or two before his next stop.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the beginning, he packed a lunch from home. But as the pace of the job picked up,
              even that small comfort slipped away. Now, he eats while driving, grabbing some bread
              rolls or a few crackers with one hand between stops.
            </p>

            <p>
              Misunderstandings sometimes made Jiang’s work harder — once, a resident shouted and
              blocked his way as he tried to enter a secured building. Yet small acts of kindness
              eased the isolation: security guards began nodding in recognition, and residents
              occasionally helped him find the right door, offering fleeting warmth in an unfamiliar
              world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most nights, he didn’t return until after dark, sometimes not until nine or ten. His
              wife waited up for him. The two kids were already asleep on a mattress in the corner
              of the shared apartment. Jiang sat in the kitchen, eating the day’s only hot meal.
            </p>

            <p>Back in China, Jiang had a degree, a stable job, and professional respect.</p>

            <p>Here, all of that was erased.</p>

                    enterprise in Shenzhen. He earned 50,000 yuan a month (around $7,000), had his

                <p>For Leo, the decision to leave China had more to do with the system itself.</p>

                <p>
                  Before crossing the border, Leo was a mid-level manager at a state-owned
                  enterprise (SOE) in Shenzhen. He earned 50,000 yuan a month (around $7,000), had
                  his own office, generous benefits, and a clear promotion path. To most people, he
                  had a job for life.
                </p>

                <p>However, Leo felt he was slowly suffocating.</p>

                <p>
                  Over two years at the SOE, he had frequent contact with private contractors.
                  Hoping to secure deals, many of them offered small gifts as a way to build
                  relationships. What began as informal gestures and networking gradually turned
                  into open corruption, with bribes and kickbacks exchanged without pretense. Inside
                  the company, things weren’t much better. Employees were expected to work overtime,
                  and managers routinely berated subordinates in front of their peers.
                </p>

                <p>Leo saw no way to change it.</p>

                <p>
                  To cope, he began climbing China’s digital firewall to read foreign news. What he
                  found shocked him—accounts of political events that were censored at home: the
                  Tiananmen crackdown, the 2022 “white paper” protests, and more.
                </p>

                <p>“It opened my brain,” he said. “I realized what China really was.”</p>

                <p>
                  In late 2023, Leo quit his job. He packed a backpack and set off to “see the
                  world.” His journey took him through Europe, Egypt, and Mexico—before finally
                  reaching the United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Like many newly arrived Chinese migrants, when first landing in the U.S., Leo
                  headed straight to Monterey Park, a city east of downtown Los Angeles.
                </p>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <p>
                  Monterey Park holds a unique place in U.S. history: It was the first city where
                  Asian Americans became the majority population. According to ACS 2023 data, 64% of
                  residents in Monterey Park are Asian, more than double the rate in California.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Street signs are bilingual, storefronts are covered in simplified Chinese
                  characters. Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hokkien echo through the air, with English
                  heard only occasionally.
                </p>

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  For Leo, Monterey Park wasn’t just a temporary refuge. It was a transitional space
                  between two worlds. It was America, but also a different version of China.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Though he lived in a place that felt familiar, Leo didn’t feel at home. The early
                  months in the U.S., he said, were the darkest period of his life.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Within two weeks of landing in the U.S., Leo’s 5-year long-term relationship
                  ended. His family urged him to return. Old colleagues drifted away.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each morning, he woke to a rising wave of emptiness. On the worst days, he would
                  lie in bed crying for an hour before he could bring himself to stand.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To cope, he began taking sleeping pills. For a time, Leo couldn’t even bring
                  himself to look for work. He lived off his savings, unable to move forward.
                </p>

                <p>He wasn’t alone.</p>

                <p>
                  At the time, he was staying with a fellow new immigrant whom he had met online.
                  That friend confided that he, too, had spiraled into depression, plagued by
                  homesickness and isolation. The man had seriously considered returning to China,
                  but ultimately said: “I’ve come this far. I have to hold on.”
                </p>

                <p>Nearly three months passed like this—adrift, unemployed, and alone.</p>

                <p>
                  One day, Leo walked into a popular noodle shop tucked in Monterey Park. As it
                  happened, they were short-staffed. Leo then landed his first job in the U.S.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He stood behind the cashier counter, slightly hunched, dark circles under his
                  eyes, stubble dusting his chin. His hands folded neatly in front of him, smiling
                  politely at each customer who walked in.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once a deputy manager at a state-owned enterprise in Shenzhen, earning over 50,000
                  yuan a month, he now served steaming bowls of hand-pulled noodles to strangers.

                </figure>

                <p>
                  When he wasn’t working, Leo chose to spend most of his time alone. Sometimes,
                  while grocery shopping, he couldn’t help but think of the time he’d spent with his
                  ex-girlfriend, his family, and his friends.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He knew those days were gone. Though he had made some new friends, everyone was
                  focused on survival.

            <h2>Shadow of Deportation</h2>
            <p>
              Rebuilding a life in a foreign land is never easy. For undocumented immigrants, the
              constant threat of deportation makes it even harder.
            </p>

            <p>
              After returning to the White House, Donald Trump announced what he called “the largest
              deportation operation in U.S. history,” pledging to remove millions of undocumented
              immigrants within his first year back in office.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids began surfacing across the
              country, including some cases involving people with valid visas.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 32,000 undocumented
              immigrants were arrested by ICE within the first 50 days of Trump’s return to office.
            </p>

            <p>
              In his spare time, Leo often browsed the LA Chinese News app. Stories or rumors of ICE
              activity appeared almost daily. The anxiety wore on him.
            </p>

            <p>
              He even hesitated to buy a car, fearing that if he were suddenly deported, there would
              be no way to deal with the property he left behind.
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo said the number of new Chinese migrants had clearly declined this year. Regular
              customers who used to frequent the noodle shop had dropped by a third. The
              restaurant’s revenue plummeted. Staff were cut by a quarter. His monthly income shrank
              from $6,000 to $4,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the entrance to the Fatty Ding Plaza, a Cantonese restaurant called ABC Cafe, open
              for 38 years, saw the same trend. The owner, Mr. Huang, said the place had long served
              immigrants who had just arrived in the U.S., but that clientele had all but vanished.
            </p>

            <p>Business dropped by 10%.</p>

            <p>
              In Monterey Park, some lawyers and NGOs distribute guides for immigrants on how to
              protect their legal rights if confronted by ICE.

              Despite the unsettling rumors, Jiang said he was not overly concerned. His lawyer told
              him that the highest-risk individuals were those with final removal orders or past
              convictions and as someone still in the asylum system, Jiang was unlikely to be
              targeted. He added that he believes in the U.S. legal system, even amid Trump’s
              immigration crackdown and shifting policies.

            <h2>Uncertain Future</h2>
            <p>February marked Leo’s first Lunar New Year in America.</p>

            <p>
              For millions of Chinese people, the Spring Festival is the most joyous time of the
              year. It is a time for family reunions, long dinners, and crowded living rooms.
            </p>

            <p>But for Leo, it was just another day.</p>

            <p>
              There were no relatives to visit, no feast to prepare. He ate a simple meal with a few
              coworkers in the restaurant where he worked.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unsettling immigration policy and repetitive work at the noodle shop made Leo couldn’t
              see a clear future.
            </p>

            <p>
              When asked whether he regretted leaving behind a stable job, a secure life, and
              financial comfort in China, Leo fell silent.
            </p>

            <p>After a long pause, he sighed:</p>

            <p>“At this stage? It doesn’t feel worth it. I gave up too much.”</p>

            <p>
              And yet, Leo said he was content. He got along well with his coworkers and his boss.
              Here, he didn’t have to flatter superiors or navigate office politics and corruption.
              The simplicity lightened something inside him.
            </p>

            <p>
              “This is just a transition,” he said. “Once I come out of the depression, I know I can
              do more. I believe in myself. And I believe in this country.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Now and then, he allowed himself small pleasures. He loved electronic music festivals,
              something he had rarely experienced in China. Since moving to Los Angeles, he had
              already attended two. He described the energy, the openness, the crowd.
            </p>

            <p>“One day,” he said, “my future self will thank me for what I’m doing now.”</p>

            <p>Since arriving in the U.S., Leo’s version of the American dream wasn’t grand.</p>

            <p>
              “I just want to live a little more comfortably,” he said. “To save a bit, maybe travel
              now and then. One day, if I’m lucky, buy a home and settle down.”
            </p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Jiang and his family were also learning to adapt.</p>

            <p>
              His delivery job had little in the way of prospects. Still, he decided to stick with
              it. He didn’t dwell on what might come next. For now, making ends meet was enough.
            </p>

            <p>
              What mattered most wasn’t money or comfort, but setting an example for his children,
              showing them that life wasn’t just about taking, it was also about contributing.
            </p>

            <p>
              To Jiang, giving was as important as receiving. He had one day off per week. Instead
              of resting, he volunteered at a food bank in Montebello, handing out free meals to
              families in need.
            </p>

            <p>
              In his eyes, the American dream was already half-fulfilled once he landed in this new
              country.
            </p>

            <p>“Becoming an American is my ultimate goal,” he said, without hesitation.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>
              Near midnight, after a long day, Jiang washed up and slipped into bed. This is the
              only moment of the day that truly belongs to him. In the darkness, the last thing he
              did was set his alarm for 5 a.m. the next morning.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meanwhile, Leo turned off the lights at the noodle shop and caught the No. 70 bus back
              to the room he shared with others. Zhang was still hustling through the streets of
              Hollywood, delivering late-night orders. Chen returned to his company, lay down on a
              folding bed, and began mapping out the next day’s delivery routes.
            </p>

            <p>The city was quiet.</p>

            <p>In a few hours, as the sun rose again, they would all be back on the road.</p>
