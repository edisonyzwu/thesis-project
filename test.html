                Tens of thousands of Chinese have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since the pandemic,
                leaving behind middle-class lives in China for an American Dream that remains far
                from reach under the second Trump administration.

                t 5 a.m., Denvy Jiang’s alarm buzzes to life. Outside, the streets are still cloaked
                in darkness. In the next room, his wife and two children remain fast asleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jiang rises quietly, careful not to wake his wife and two children or the four other
                families in the shared house. He wolfs down a few bites of the breakfast his wife
                set out the night before, grabs his car key and slips into his secondhand Honda.
              </p>

              <p>
                Minutes later, he’s merging onto the 88 highway, bound for a delivery warehouse
                nearly 20 miles away.
              </p>

              <p>
                Six months ago, his life looked quite different. He lived in China with his wife,
                where they owned their home and enjoyed a more comfortable life as private tutors —
                a profession offering social respect and substantial earnings.
              </p>

              <p>
                But Jiang had publicly questioned the government, putting him and his family at
                risk.
              </p>

              <p>
                They sold their home and car, traveled through Japan and then made their way to
                Mexico. Under the cover of night, they crossed the U.S.–Mexico border with their
                young son and daughter—entering a country they had never set foot in.
              </p>

              <p>
                They have joined tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants who, in the wake of the
                pandemic, took the costly route to the U.S. — leaving middle-class jobs and stable
                lives behind, hoping to plant new roots in unfamiliar soil and escape political
                repression and economic uncertainty.
              </p>

            <div class="nutgraph">
              <p>
                Before 2021, only a single-digit number of Chinese migrants crossed the U.S.–Mexico
                border.
              </p>

              <p>
                By 2023, that number had surged to over a thousand daily, peaking at nearly 6,000 in
                December.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since the pandemic, more than 60,000 Chinese nationals have crossed the border,
                making China the fastest-growing source of undocumented migration.
              </p>

              <p>
                While many Latin American migrants flee war or poverty, many Chinese newcomers come
                from China’s urban middle class, who were once teachers, business owners, and civil
                servants.
              </p>

              <p>
                In post-pandemic China, a slowing economy and growing political pressure pushed some
                to look abroad. Online, they found step-by-step guides to reach the U.S.—a risky
                journey through multiple countries that ends at the border and can cost $10,000 to
                $40,000.
              </p>

              <p>
                For those who make it across the border, their challenges just begin: low-wage jobs,
                the threat of deportation, and the loneliness of life in a foreign land.

              <h2>Broken Middle-Class Dream</h2>
              <p>
                Jiang grew up in a small county town in Jiangsu province, near Shanghai. Ten years
                ago, fresh out of vocational college, he became an English tutor.
              </p>

              <p>
                For years, he and his wife commuted between Jiangsu and Shanghai — he taught
                English, she taught math. They worked only on weekends and spent the rest of the
                week at home with their children. During holidays, they often traveled abroad, with
                Japan as a favorite destination.
              </p>

              <p>
                In May 2018, after years of saving, they bought their first car: a new Chevrolet.
                Later that year, they purchased a 1,400-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in
                their hometown—a place they could finally call home.
              </p>

              <p>To their friends, Jiang’s life looked stable and respectable, even enviable.</p>

              <p>But he longed for one thing China forbade: freedom of expression.</p>

              <p>
                Since high school, Jiang had been bypassing China’s internet firewall to access
                foreign news. He noticed that in the U.S., people can speak freely to criticize
                authority and participate in politics.
              </p>

              <p>
                Around 2015, when WeChat became widely used in China, Jiang said he launched a
                public account and started publishing essays, pointing out what he saw as government
                failures.
              </p>
