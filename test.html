                Tens of thousands of Chinese have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since the pandemic,
                leaving behind middle-class lives in China for an American Dream that remains far
                from reach under the second Trump administration.

                t 5 a.m., Denvy Jiang’s alarm buzzes to life. Outside, the streets are still cloaked
                in darkness. In the next room, his wife and two children remain fast asleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jiang rises quietly, careful not to wake his wife and two children or the four other
                families in the shared house. He wolfs down a few bites of the breakfast his wife
                set out the night before, grabs his car key and slips into his secondhand Honda.
              </p>

              <p>
                Minutes later, he’s merging onto the 88 highway, bound for a delivery warehouse
                nearly 20 miles away.
              </p>

              <p>
                Six months ago, his life looked quite different. He lived in China with his wife,
                where they owned their home and enjoyed a more comfortable life as private tutors —
                a profession offering social respect and substantial earnings.
              </p>

              <p>
                But Jiang had publicly questioned the government, putting him and his family at
                risk.
              </p>

              <p>
                They sold their home and car, traveled through Japan and then made their way to
                Mexico. Under the cover of night, they crossed the U.S.–Mexico border with their
                young son and daughter—entering a country they had never set foot in.
              </p>

              <p>
                They have joined tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants who, in the wake of the
                pandemic, took the costly route to the U.S. — leaving middle-class jobs and stable
                lives behind, hoping to plant new roots in unfamiliar soil and escape political
                repression and economic uncertainty.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="nutgraph">
              <p>
                Before 2021, only a single-digit number of Chinese migrants crossed the U.S.–Mexico
                border.
              </p>

              <p>
                By 2023, that number had surged to over a thousand daily, peaking at nearly 6,000 in
                December.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since the pandemic, more than 60,000 Chinese nationals have crossed the border,
                making China the fastest-growing source of undocumented migration.
              </p>

              <p>
                While many Latin American migrants flee war or poverty, many Chinese newcomers come
                from China’s urban middle class, who were once teachers, business owners, and civil
                servants.
              </p>

              <p>
                In post-pandemic China, a slowing economy and growing political pressure pushed some
                to look abroad. Online, they found step-by-step guides to reach the U.S.—a risky
                journey through multiple countries that ends at the border and can cost $10,000 to
                $40,000.
              </p>

              <p>
                For those who make it across the border, their challenges just begin: low-wage jobs,
                the threat of deportation, and the loneliness of life in a foreign land.

              <h2>Broken Middle-Class Dream</h2>
              <p>
                Jiang grew up in a small county town in Jiangsu province, near Shanghai. Ten years
                ago, fresh out of vocational college, he became an English tutor.
              </p>

              <p>
                For years, he and his wife commuted between Jiangsu and Shanghai — he taught
                English, she taught math. They worked only on weekends and spent the rest of the
                week at home with their children. During holidays, they often traveled abroad, with
                Japan as a favorite destination.
              </p>

              <p>
                In May 2018, after years of saving, they bought their first car: a new Chevrolet.
                Later that year, they purchased a 1,400-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in
                their hometown—a place they could finally call home.
              </p>

              <p>To their friends, Jiang’s life looked stable and respectable, even enviable.</p>

              <p>But he longed for one thing China forbade: freedom of expression.</p>

              <p>
                Since high school, Jiang had been bypassing China’s internet firewall to access
                foreign news. He noticed that in the U.S., people can speak freely to criticize
                authority and participate in politics.
              </p>

              <p>
                Around 2015, when WeChat became widely used in China, Jiang said he launched a
                public account and started publishing essays, pointing out what he saw as government
                failures.
              </p>

              <p>
                His most popular article criticizing the government drew more than 60,000 views, but
                none of his friends showed support.
              </p>

              <p>
                “People couldn’t understand why I’d challenge the government,” he said. “They
                thought I was asking for trouble.”
              </p>

              <p>Still, Jiang believed it was his duty to speak up.</p>

              <p>“Everyone wants their country to get better,” he said, tearing up.</p>

              <p>Eventually, local authorities took notice.</p>

              <p>
                At first, the police took a relatively restrained approach. They asked Jiang to
                delete his articles and warned him not to publish similar content again. But as the
                warnings piled up, so did the pressure. The tone grew harsher, then came the
                threats.
              </p>

              <p>
                Jiang said the police didn’t just target him. They warned that if he was labeled a
                political dissident, his children might be barred from school or later denied jobs
                in the government.
              </p>

              <p>
                Constantly worried about his family's safety and future, Jiang was eventually
                diagnosed with major depression.
              </p>

              <p>
                “I had a decent job in China,” he said, “but I couldn’t trade it for the right to
                speak freely. I have a family. I have kids. If I get locked up for a few years, what
                happens to them?”
              </p>

              <p>The final blow came during the pandemic.</p>

              <p>
                China’s zero-COVID policies had already made life difficult, but what alarmed Jiang
                most was the government’s tight control of information. Even during major public
                tragedies and protests, he noticed little to no coverage on domestic platforms. To
                learn what was happening in his own country, he bypassed the firewall and turned to
                Twitter and YouTube.
              </p>

              <p>Tired of living in the dark — he knew it was time to leave.</p>

              <p>
                For him, the decision was driven by a desire to escape political suppression.
                Others, like Chao Chen, 44, were pushed by the economic fallout of the pandemic.
              </p>

              <p>
                For more than two decades, he had run a small security equipment company in China,
                managing a team of ten. He earned over one million yuan a year (roughly $140,000),
                placing him well above the national average.
              </p>

              <p>Then the pandemic upended everything.</p>

              <p>
                China’s strict zero-COVID lockdowns triggered widespread job losses. In just the
                first two months of 2020, five million positions vanished, and Tens of thousands of
                private businesses collapsed. According to the corporate registry platform
                Tianyancha, over 460,000 small and medium-sized enterprises were dissolved in early
                2022 alone.
              </p>

              <p>
                Chinese consumers have turned more cautious, citing concerns over wage growth and
                job security as companies cut staff to preserve profits and competitiveness. The
                country’s consumer confidence index fell to its lowest level since the COVID-19
                outbreak and remains depressed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Chen’s business began to falter. He found himself thinking back to his youth — his
                early interest in English, his dreams of working in international trade, and maybe
                one day going abroad.
              </p>

              <p>
                To him, America represented higher wages, greater personal freedom, better
                healthcare, and more opportunities for his son.
              </p>

              <p>
                Chen planned to go first, alone, and try to build a foundation in the U.S. If it
                worked, he would bring his wife and son later.
              </p>

              <p>
                He never imagined that, twenty years later, he would pursue a long-abandoned dream,
                even if it meant leaving behind those he loved most.

              <h2>Journey to the US</h2>
              <p>
                For some, entry to the U.S. was relatively easy, requiring nothing more than a
                tourist visa.
              </p>

              <p>
                But since the 2015 fiscal year, the number of non-immigrant visas issued to Chinese
                nationals has dropped sharply.
              </p>

              <p>As access shrank, new — and sometimes dangerous — pathways emerged.</p>

              <p>
                Jiang and his family, who had multiple entries to Japan on record, were eligible to
                enter Mexico visa-free. From there, they traveled to the border city of Tijuana,
                then crossed into the U.S.
              </p>

              <p>
                Others were not so lucky. Without visa exemptions, many Chinese migrants were forced
                to take longer, more dangerous, and far more expensive journeys.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some tried to schedule asylum appointments through the U.S. Customs and Border
                Protection mobile app, CBP One. But the app had no Chinese-language interface and
                its opaque scheduling system left many confused and frustrated. For some, waiting
                wasn't an option. They chose instead to scale the border wall at night and apply for
                asylum afterward.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once they reached the U.S., migrants were immediately detained by immigration
                authorities — some held for a single day, others for weeks or even months.
              </p>

              <p>
                Their asylum cases can take years to process, and during that time, they are not
                permitted to leave the country.

              <h2>American Dream from the Bottom</h2>
              <p>
                Two months after arriving in the U.S., the country he believes offers him freedom of
                speech, Jiang earned his driver’s license and landed his first job — a package
                delivery driver.
              </p>

              <p>
                Paid $1.80 to $2.00 per package, his earnings depended on how many deliveries he
                could make each day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Though Jiang knew that he had to “start from the ground up” in the U.S., reality was
                still harsher than he had imagined, he said.
              </p>

              <p>
                While he had worked just three days a week with little physical effort back in
                China, now, he is on the road six days a week, working ten hours or more each day
                with barely any time to rest.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before the sun rose, Jiang was already en route to his first stop: the warehouse.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the warehouse, dozens of tall metal carts packed with grey plastic-wrapped
                parcels were already lined up in rows.
              </p>

              <p>Jiang said he usually delivered between 150 and 180 packages a day.</p>

              <p>
                He located the cart marked with his route number and strained to push it toward his
                car’s trunk. Each package was scanned into his phone’s dispatch system and assigned
                a route code.
              </p>

              <p>Over time, the routine became second nature: scan, tag, sort, load.</p>

              <p>
                Box after box filled the back of the car. Soon, the passenger seat and rear seats
                were piled high with parcels. Only the driver’s seat remained clear.
              </p>

              <p>After nearly six months on the job, he had run every route three or four times.</p>

              <p>
                He knew which intersections always backed up, which buildings had broken buzzers,
                and which doorways hid aggressive dogs.
              </p>

              <p>
                By 7:30 a.m., Jiang entered the address for his first delivery into the GPS and
                began his route.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the stop, he rummaged through the back of the car to find the correct package,
                scanned it, double-checked the address, and stepped out. He glanced around for the
                correct unit number, jogged to the front porch, gently placed the parcel by the
                door, snapped a photo for proof of delivery, and then jogged back to the car. With
                one hand on the seatbelt, he punched in the next address as the engine revved again.
              </p>

              <p>
                The entire process took less than three minutes, but he had to repeat it over a
                hundred times a day.
              </p>

              <p>
                During deliveries, Jiang often wore a furrowed brow and tight lips, like a sprinter
                at the starting line, every second counting toward the final result.
              </p>

              <p>
                By noon, his shirt was drenched in sweat. He’d jump back into the car and crank the
                A/C, but could afford to cool down for only a minute or two before his next stop.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the beginning, he packed a lunch from home. But as the pace of the job picked up,
                even that small comfort slipped away. Now, he eats while driving, grabbing some
                bread rolls or a few crackers with one hand between stops.
              </p>

              <p>
                Misunderstandings sometimes made Jiang’s work harder — once, a resident shouted and
                blocked his way as he tried to enter a secured building. Yet small acts of kindness
                eased the isolation: security guards began nodding in recognition, and residents
                occasionally helped him find the right door, offering fleeting warmth in an
                unfamiliar world.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most nights, he didn’t return until after dark, sometimes not until nine or ten. His
                wife waited up for him. The two kids were already asleep on a mattress in the corner
                of the shared apartment. Jiang sat in the kitchen, eating the day’s only hot meal.
              </p>

              <p>Back in China, Jiang had a degree, a stable job, and professional respect.</p>

              <p>Here, all of that was erased.</p>

              <h2>Shadow of Deportation</h2>
              <p>
                Rebuilding a life in a foreign land is never easy. For undocumented immigrants, the
                constant threat of deportation makes it even harder.
              </p>

              <p>
                After returning to the White House, Donald Trump announced what he called “the
                largest deportation operation in U.S. history,” pledging to remove millions of
                undocumented immigrants within his first year back in office.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids began surfacing across
                the country, including some cases involving people with valid visas.
              </p>

              <p>
                According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 32,000 undocumented
                immigrants were arrested by ICE within the first 50 days of Trump’s return to
                office.
              </p>

              <p>
                In his spare time, Leo often browsed the LA Chinese News app. Stories or rumors of
                ICE activity appeared almost daily. The anxiety wore on him.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              He even hesitated to buy a car, fearing that if he were suddenly deported, there would
              be no way to deal with the property he left behind.
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo said the number of new Chinese migrants had clearly declined this year. Regular
              customers who used to frequent the noodle shop had dropped by a third. The
              restaurant’s revenue plummeted. Staff were cut by a quarter. His monthly income shrank
              from $6,000 to $4,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the entrance to the Fatty Ding Plaza, a Cantonese restaurant called ABC Cafe, open
              for 38 years, saw the same trend. The owner, Mr. Huang, said the place had long served
              immigrants who had just arrived in the U.S., but that clientele had all but vanished.
            </p>

            <p>Business dropped by 10%.</p>

            <p>
              In Monterey Park, some lawyers and NGOs distribute guides for immigrants on how to
              protect their legal rights if confronted by ICE.
            </p>

            <div>
              Despite the unsettling rumors, Jiang said he was not overly concerned. His lawyer told
              him that the highest-risk individuals were those with final removal orders or past
              convictions and as someone still in the asylum system, Jiang was unlikely to be
              targeted. He added that he believes in the U.S. legal system, even amid Trump’s
              immigration crackdown and shifting policies.

              <h2>Uncertain Future</h2>
              <p>February marked Leo’s first Lunar New Year in America.</p>

              <p>
                For millions of Chinese people, the Spring Festival is the most joyous time of the
                year. It is a time for family reunions, long dinners, and crowded living rooms.
              </p>

              <p>But for Leo, it was just another day.</p>

              <p>
                There were no relatives to visit, no feast to prepare. He ate a simple meal with a
                few coworkers in the restaurant where he worked.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unsettling immigration policy and repetitive work at the noodle shop made Leo
                couldn’t see a clear future.
              </p>

              <p>
                When asked whether he regretted leaving behind a stable job, a secure life, and
                financial comfort in China, Leo fell silent.
              </p>

              <p>After a long pause, he sighed:</p>

              <p>“At this stage? It doesn’t feel worth it. I gave up too much.”</p>

              <p>
                And yet, Leo said he was content. He got along well with his coworkers and his boss.
                Here, he didn’t have to flatter superiors or navigate office politics and
                corruption. The simplicity lightened something inside him.
              </p>

              <p>
                “This is just a transition,” he said. “Once I come out of the depression, I know I
                can do more. I believe in myself. And I believe in this country.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Now and then, he allowed himself small pleasures. He loved electronic music
                festivals, something he had rarely experienced in China. Since moving to Los
                Angeles, he had already attended two. He described the energy, the openness, the
                crowd.
              </p>

              <p>“One day,” he said, “my future self will thank me for what I’m doing now.”</p>

              <p>Since arriving in the U.S., Leo’s version of the American dream wasn’t grand.</p>

              <p>
                “I just want to live a little more comfortably,” he said. “To save a bit, maybe
                travel now and then. One day, if I’m lucky, buy a home and settle down.”
              </p>

              <p>Meanwhile, Jiang and his family were also learning to adapt.</p>

              <p>
                His delivery job had little in the way of prospects. Still, he decided to stick with
                it. He didn’t dwell on what might come next. For now, making ends meet was enough.
              </p>

              <p>
                What mattered most wasn’t money or comfort, but setting an example for his children,
                showing them that life wasn’t just about taking, it was also about contributing.
              </p>

              <p>
                To Jiang, giving was as important as receiving. He had one day off per week. Instead
                of resting, he volunteered at a food bank in Montebello, handing out free meals to
                families in need.
              </p>

              <p>
                In his eyes, the American dream was already half-fulfilled once he landed in this
                new country.
              </p>

              <p>“Becoming an American is my ultimate goal,” he said, without hesitation.</p>

              <p>
                Near midnight, after a long day, Jiang washed up and slipped into bed. This is the
                only moment of the day that truly belongs to him. In the darkness, the last thing he
                did was set his alarm for 5 a.m. the next morning.
              </p>

              <p>
                Meanwhile, Leo turned off the lights at the noodle shop and caught the No. 70 bus
                back to the room he shared with others. Zhang was still hustling through the streets
                of Hollywood, delivering late-night orders. Chen returned to his company, lay down
                on a folding bed, and began mapping out the next day’s delivery routes.
              </p>

              <p>The city was quiet.</p>

              <p>In a few hours, as the sun rose again, they would all be back on the road.</p>
